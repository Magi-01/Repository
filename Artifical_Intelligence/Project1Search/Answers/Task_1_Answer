Q: Is the exploration order something expected?
A: Yes, because DFS explores one direction to the terminal node first. Here, it goes horizontally until reaching the goal.

Q: Does Pacman move physically to all the explored squares on his way to the goal?
A: No, Pacman only follows the path with directions to the goal; he doesn't move through all explored squares.

Q: Is this a least-cost solution?
A: No, DFS finds a solution but doesn’t guarantee it’s the lowest-cost path. There exists a more cost-effective route.

q. If not, what is depth-first search doing wrong?
a. DFS fails to find the least-cost solution because it explores paths deeply without considering path length or cost. It often follows longer, less efficient routes to reach the goal. DFS does not prioritize optimal paths, leading to suboptimal solutions.
